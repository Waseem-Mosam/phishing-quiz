  <h1>7 Tips to ensure your Privacy Online!</h1>

  <div class="container2">
    <h3>1. Use Strong and Unique Passwords.</h3>
    <p>
      Create complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. 
      Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using 
      a password manager to keep track of your passwords securely.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever possible, enable 2FA for your online accounts. 
      This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second 
      verification step, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Beware of Phishing Scams.</h3>
    <p>
      Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls asking for personal information. 
      Phishing scams often impersonate trusted organizations to trick you into revealing sensitive data.
      If you receive an unsolicited email, a rule of thumb is to not open any attachments or click any links.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Use Encrypted Messaging Apps.</h3>
    <p>
      Choose messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only you and the intended 
      recipient can read your messages. Signal and WhatsApp are examples of secure options.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).</h3>
    <p>
      Consider using a VPN to encrypt your internet connection and mask your IP address. 
      This is especially useful to protect your online activities and data from prying eyes
      when using public Wi-Fi networks.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Keep Software Updated.</h3>
    <p>
      Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and software applications. 
      Updates often include security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <h3>7. Verify if website is secure.</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever you access websites where you will need to input personal information such as card
      information or any other sensitive information, ensure the site has a padlock icon next to the site
      name, usually on the left. This lock icon indicats the connection between the broswer and site is 
      secure therefore there will be no hacker able to steal your sensitive information whilst on the site.
